Welcome to this amazing website. In this website, you will be learing about Firefox Extension development. Our main aim is to make sure you are learning Extension development step by step and easily.

Aim
===

- Learn each and every WebExtension API from another developer / contributor with Simple Example.
- We also wanted to discuss in detail about Each and every Event with demo

Who Built this Website
======================

This website is maintained by Contributors like you. Our request is once you learn developing website, make sure you practice using the API by developing small extension, it will be really great if you can share your code of the Extension in Github, and according to the API post you send a pull request of your code. For example if you have used Alarms API, then in  Alarms API Post there will be section named Contributor Examples. Under that section you can add yours.

The format is  name of the extension hyperlinked with github source code.

Since we are using the Markdown, the format is  inside the square bracks ([name]) add the name, and without any space after the end of sqare bracket add parentheses round brackets (), inside the round bracket add the link.

Example [ name of your Add-on](Link) 

- [] inside of this is name of Add-on
- () inside of this is link


Writing API docs
================

We will be very happy if contributors can help us to teach about various API throught their Add-ons Code. Each and every post is sorted based on the date and time, so we will be very carefully reviewing them.
